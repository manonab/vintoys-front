          Hello there, fellow game enthusiasts and toy collectors! I'm Manon, the
          mastermind behind Capiche. Picture this: one fine day, I embarked on a quest to
          find the perfect vintage board game, but alas, my noble search was in vain.
          There was no dedicated platform that truly understood the magic of vintage games
          and the joy of secondhand toys.
